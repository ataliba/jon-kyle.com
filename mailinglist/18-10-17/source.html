<p>Hey there,</p>

<p>Happy autumn! All sorts of new things. Let’s get to it.</p>

<h2>Whyspace</h2>

</figure>

<p>In this time of solutionism, when there is a technological answer for everything, remember to ask questions. Whyspace is a new project, a non-place for questioning, and it’s taking me to London between October 22–29.</p>

<p>There will be a stop at <a href="https://wwhhyy.space/events/18-10-24-mozfest">MozFest on the 24th</a>, for those attending the conference, and <a href="https://wwhhyy.space/events/18-10-25-evening-class">Evening Class on the 25th</a>, open to the public. Both will be livestreamed at <a href="https://wwhhyy.space">wwhhyy.space</a>.</p>

<h2>Peer-to-Peer Web</h2>

</figure>

<p>It would be inaccurate to say Peer-to-Peer Web is winding down, it’s just time for new things. A year has passed since we began hosting a series of relaxed and informative hangouts for anyone interested in the evolving web.</p>

<p>We leave behind an archive containing hours of talks given by participants at hangouts in Los Angeles, New York City, and Berlin. They range in topic, but have in common a hopeful speculation of possible futures, online, offline, and that liminal space in between.</p>

<p>For more about this <a href="https://peer-to-peer-web.com/note">head over to Peer-to-Peer Web</a>, or tune into the livestream on October 18th.</p>

<h2>Arroyo Walk</h2>

</figure>

<p>Taking a break often brings me out to the San Gabriel mountains, visible from my front door some 20 miles away. With this being Los Angeles, the distance between my place and a hike is traversed by car and freeway, creating a separation between here and there. To better understand the relation I walked the length between the two, creating a sort of symbolic link them.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://arroyo.jon-kyle.com">the walk itself</a>, then head over to <a href="https://jon-kyle.com/entries/2018-10-01-walking-the-arroyo">the reflection essay</a>, if you’d like.</p>

<h2>Hang #6</h2>

<p>Tomorrow I’ll be doing a brief livestream going over the changes to Peer-to-Peer Web, the introduction of Whyspace, and available to riff on questions. To join, just <a href="https://jon-kyle.com/hangs">navigate to the hangs</a> around noon PST on the 18th, or catch it later once it’s archived.</p>
