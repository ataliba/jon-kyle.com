It’s late afternoon in Los Angeles, and my sight has been focused on the backlight of a screen for a few hours. The same was likely true of yesterday, a choice to manipulate bits of material acting as memory distributed across oceans. Within an environment so abstract there is sometimes difficulty placing oneself within it, both in time (*where did it go?*) and space (*where is here?*) It’s hard to pull yourself away. It goes against the use-case.

Escape often brings me out to the San Gabriel mountains, visible from my front door some 20 miles away. It’s either full on or full off. Taking five minutes distraction-free is near impossible, but the greater the gesture the easier commitment. Being in the mountains makes it hard to be impulsive. With this being Los Angeles, the distance is traversed by car and freeway, separating *here* and *there*. 

Of course, nature is not somewhere we go to, but something we live within, urban condition and all. William Cronon hits on this particularly well in the essay [The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature](http://williamcronon.net/writing/Trouble_with_Wilderness_Main.html).[^1]

To better understand this for myself, I walked through the threshold of my front door to the foothills of the San Gabriels.

When conceiving of any project I find myself sketching in the browser. Everything ends up being on a screen anyway—it makes for an obvious starting point when considering form, and I find programming the medium most conducive to capturing ideas.

</div>

The work of Richard Long and Bas Jan Ader have been sources of continual interest, although thinking on them was not directly incorporated into the process.

Through repetition Long leaves a mark on the landscape by walking a line, a modest physical intervention. The temporality of the work is made permanent through image making, a photograph  on film with the line centered in frame.

Bas Jan Ader is perhaps best known for his gravity works, short video pieces provoking anticipation from the viewer of an ultimate fall. Often selecting film as the medium of choice, Ader instead captured his own walk across Los Angeles with a series of fourteen photographs depicting a lone figure. The walk began in the Hollywood Hills and ended at the Port of Los Angeles, but the representation of continuity has [come into question](https://willcenci.com/projects-2/in-search-of-in-search-of-the-miraculous/), as the locations span some 32 miles, requiring a generously brisk pace to be completed in a single evening on foot.

Looking back, clearly extensive change has occurred in the intervening years. The internet, GPS, and a camera in everyones’ pocket has drastically altered image making and distribution. What would Richard Long’s line look like in the era of “big data?”

Whereas he created a line left in the grass, my walk will be marked by the resulting metadata, phone in pocket.

In addition to the goal of better understanding what generates the subjective illusion of “there”, this notion of self-surveillance became central to the walk. Watching oneself traverse a landscape, and exposing this stream real-time to others. A continuous redefinition of “here” marked by points along a path.

The page began as a line indicating the intended path along the [Los Angeles river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_River) and [Arroyo Seco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arroyo_Seco_(Los_Angeles_County)), both channelized after a series of floods, the concrete eventually implying a course through the contours of the area when freeway construction began. The path overlaid a tile layer of shaded relief, the rivers appearing as deep cuts in the sprawl.

At this point the page was heavy with features. The map would pan and zoom when new points were added. It began to feel like a poorly implemented mapping application, not a personal exploration in place. Also, a side-effect of having pin-point accuracy when sharing a location on a social network is the subsequent attention it draws. Areas once requiring effort to locate are now disclosed to whomever bothers to scroll, leading to increased erosion and other issues. “Digital leave no trace” is a popular phrase promoting geographic ambiguity when sharing a photo, and borrows from a term suggesting you leave a place as you found it. This is a complex issue requiring careful consideration regarding accessibility, conservation, and the specificity of a pin drop.

Considering this led to removing most of the functionality, the terrain map, and substituting pins for circles denoting approximate locale. Clearly I’m not concerned about foot traffic damaging an environment which sees hundreds of thousands of cars per day, but it was useful as a focusing mechanism.

The page became blank, marked only by a red line indicating the intended path from here to there, devoid of meaning without depiction of surrounding urbanization. This meaning would be later assigned by an underlying feed of messages, their position on the page mapping to the path through the landscape, and giving form to the trail of metadata left behind in the concrete channels.

The walk began, and after a few minutes I changed my mind about the route. The markers began deviating from the line on the page, the difference between intent and actualization. This difference became a theme and stayed in mind as I neared the confluence of the Arroyo Seco and Los Angeles River, an area also occupied by the intersection of the 110 and 5 freeways.

The 110, spanning the distance between Downtown and Pasadena, was originally conceived as a parkway, the “goal was nothing less than the display of the physical and historic landscape of the region through windshield.”[^2] Parkways were popular on the east coast, the first having circled around Prospect Park in Brooklyn, and the regional need for enhanced modes of transportation provided an opportunity understood to better connect to the environment through experience.

> Transportation efficiency and aesthetic delight were considered inseparable goals of parkway design, which in the early 20th century was described as “bioengineering”—a marriage of architecture, landscaping and civil engineering in a three dimensional design. These dual values which resulted in the design of a road as both a route and a place were carefully incorporated in the design of the Arroyo Seco Parkway.

Above is the confluence of the Arroyo Seco and Los Angeles river—the 110 and the 5. The photograph on the left depicts an overpass in 1938 at what was Dayton Ave, only two years prior to the opening of the Arroyo Seco Parkway. To the right is the Riverside-Figueroa bridge just prior to demolition[^3]. Anecdotally, there was an effort to save the bridge from demolition, owing both to its historical significance being the oldest steel trestle bridge[^4] (cultural historic landmark #908) over the river, and for the possibility of becoming [open greenspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei1K9kz_2ns) [spanning the river](http://www.theeastsiderla.com/2013/09/is-it-too-late-to-save-the-riverside-figueroa-bridge/)—Los Angeles’ “[answer to New York’s High Line](http://laist.com/2014/06/03/sorry_la_wont_get_its_own_awesome_h.php),” a laughably inaccurate and unfair comparison at best.

On an afternoon of festivities meant to bring awareness to the possibility for a park the impossible happened: rain in LA, a foreboding omen having washed out several bridges prior. Ultimately the effort was [not feasible](https://la.streetsblog.org/2014/06/02/judge-denies-demolition-injunction-for-riverside-figueroa-bridge/) [within the master plan](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-riverside-bridge-challenge-20140530-story.html). The story remains the same(ish)!

Anyway, I’m uninterested in urban oddities and cute stories, nor am I trying to point out how strange any of this is—rather, it’s incredibly common. The question is how a historical perspective of the built environment can inform an understanding of “unbuilt” virtual environments, or that of intangible spaces afforded by network infrastructure.

> Today, the Arroyo Seco Parkway stands as a representative example of an urban parkway still in use but fraught with problems due to its disjuncture between its original conception and ultimate evolution.[^5]

Perhaps there is a lot to learn from the apparent emergence in the evolution from parkway to freeway. I wonder how much of this was lip service in an effort to ensure construction approval, or was it genuine? Of course, things are never that simple, but I doubt the current form is what anyone was expecting. The future is banal! 

I can only assume those responsible for creating the internet feel similar, as seemed evident through brief encounters when attending the [Decentralized Web Summit](/entries/2018-08-05-decentralized-web-summit) this summer.

![Placing the Twitter feed within urban condition, amusingly](feed-freeway_56.jpg)

Anyway, there are parallels between the evolution of the parkway to the freeway, the web page to the web platform. I don’t know what that implies, but it felt worth sharing.

My walk began with the intent to better understand the “here”, “there,” and how freeways and cars generate a perceptual separation between my everyday and the relative sublime of *not staring at a screen for a minute*. 🙃

I arrived at a place of greater confusion, in the foothills, deep into the feeds.
