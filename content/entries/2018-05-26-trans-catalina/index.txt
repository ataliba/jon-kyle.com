Since moving back to Los Angeles from an extended stay in New York I’ve been out in the forest often. I was there frequently before leaving, too, but it’s even more often than that was now.

While in New York I began reading about durational hiking, making your own gear (MYOG), literally watching people just walk around mountains, all to supplement the extreme lack of open space. Researching hikes to do once returning home I rediscovered a multi-day hike across Catalina Island, located just off the coast.

Never having attempted a multi-day hike before, and having little camping experience, there appeared to be much to figure out. Living in semi-rural Tennessee and and unschooling when young didn’t provide a wide variety of offline options. Days spent online for several hours, partitioned only by going on super extended walks through undeveloped subdivisons.

We lived on the edge of one such development. Walking to the end of the road was like scrubbing a frozen infrastructural timelapse. First houses, then houses without roofs, then houses without siding, then frames of houses, then foundations, then street signs and drain covers, then simply curbed road, leading to improvised piles of moved earth. A hard coordinate where the bubble burst.

Anyway, between that and doing some healthy hikes during my time living in Los Angeles, it seemed likely figure I could it out enough to get home at the end.

## Preparation and Booking

Normally there is a two night minimum stay for campgrounds. To bypass this, simply call the Two Harbors visitor services to book your campsites. Tell them you’re doing the Trans-Cat.

We stayed at [Blackjack](https://www.visitcatalinaisland.com/camping-boating/primitive-camping/blackjack), [Two Harbors](https://www.visitcatalinaisland.com/camping-and-boating/two-harbors-camping/two-harbors-campground), and [Parsons Landing](https://www.visitcatalinaisland.com/camping-boating/primitive-camping/parsons-landing).

Both Blackjack and Two Harbors have potable water on site. For Parsons Landing you’ll want to reserve a locker with 2 gallons of water and firewood. You can do that at the Guest Services booth in Two Harbors. Between booking the campsites and the ferry tickets, it was somewhat expensive compared to a typical trip. Definitely worth it, though.

Also, to be comfortable, keep your pack weight down. I was just a little shy of 20lbs at the trailhead, and am aiming closer to 15 next time. For more on my pack just scroll down the page.

## Day One

We took the 6:30am from Catalina Express from Long Beach. Leaving that early on a weekday didn’t require booking tickets beforehand, though there are few reasons not to.

It takes around an hour and a half to traverse the San Pedro channel. Once arriving in Avalon we waited around to check in, but it turns out this isn’t necessary as the permit is only for the stretch between Two Harbors and Parsons.

![Avalon with all it’s infrastructure](01-climbing-out_75.jpg)

We quickly realized most of this hike will be simply escaping the infrastructure surrounding Avalon. The up is very up at the start, and it’s on a fire road. Approaching a small shade structure we saw some kids, and when saying hello they asked “Did you know you can smoke sage?” Sick.

Before too long we were crossing our first Bison gate. Oh yeah, there is a generously sized Bison population on Catalina, introduced to the island during the [20s for a silent Western movie shoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalina_Island_bison_herd).

{imgs-auto}

![A weather station managed by LAFD](02-jk-weather_133.jpg)

![“Here be bisons”](03-jk-fence_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

After a few miles we spotted it; our first bison. It was relaxing near the edge of a water pond, maybe 40 feet from the trail. It’s suggested you stay at least 75 feet away from Bison to prevent spooking them.

We decided to go off trail. This gives the TCT an entirely unique angle. At any moment, going around a corner of the trail with some foliage, might be a bison ready to trample your ass. Only a few miles later while approaching a blind corner I caught a glimmer of bison making it’s way straight at us down the trail, I thought… We scrambled up the hill, and sure enough, there it was.

{imgs-auto}

![The access road we avoided scrambling down to](05-trail_133.jpg)

![“Yeah I’m just take my time here”](05-bison_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

This ensured we were properly paranoid for the rest of the trip whenever approaching blind corners. It was like hiking in Jurrasic Park, but instead of velociraptors they're lumbering furballs with horns.

After a few brief siestas to rest and snack we approached a sizable hill where we saw three or four *more* bison. Unable to determine if the trail passed within the Bison Bubble we continued approaching. It became clear that, yes, the trail ran directly adjacent the bison and within The Bubble. The trail followed a ridge line, requiring us to either scramble down an uncomfortably large cliff back down to the access road, or inch along off trail until clearing the crest of the hill past the bison.

Forward was the way to go.

Cresting the hill, we realized the three or four bison was more like twenty-five or thirty! A few were even laying *directly on the trail*. These things live to fuck with hikers. 

![“Yeah let’s just chill here lol”](06-bison_75.jpg)

The next few miles were super hot. After having started at around 8:30, we had done seven-ish miles and it was about noon, putting us square in the middle of the island in a valley with very little air circulation.

We made it through the last little bit and got to camp. Ate some cold-soaked meals (no stove to keep weight down) and walked around the camp, which was entirely empty save one other solo hiker.

After a minute it became clear there was a *lot* of bison shit around camp, which got me a little anxious about waking up in the middle of the night to a stampede. I digress. 

{imgs-auto}

![Roasting](07-jon_133.jpg)

![Campsite #1 at Blackjack](07-camp_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

With sunset approaching a quick walk before dinner sounded good. Following the path out of camp we’d follow tomorrow morning led to a beautiful view. Looking to our right we noticed a small structure which seemed to have *the best* panoramic view.

Upon approaching the structure we were greeted by, yeah, you guessed it, another bison giving guard. Fuck! We headed back to camp as the fog rolled in.

{imgs-auto}

![“Yo check out this vista lol jk”](08-bison_133.jpg)

![Sunsplosion](10-sunset_133.jpg)

![“ViBez”](09-fog_75.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

We got a fire going, and I finished setting up camp. This was the first time I pitched the tarp I made, which uses two trekking poles and tension from tie-outs to stay taught, and was happy to find it worked. Aside from the satisfaction of making something, the possibility to modify and improve a project created yourself makes it worth the time investment. There were already a few small adjustments I wanted to make once home.

### Tips

1. Testing
2. Yeah

## Day Two

The day started with Jon tapping on my tent and saying, “Not to freak you out, but there is a bison right next to the campsite.”

![“O u want to sleep? lol”](11-bison-camp_75.jpg)

It kept it’s distance for a while, until it disappeared. I wandered around the campsite and couldn’t spot it, but after several minutes we heard a “HRUMPH” from very close. It had wandered behind the tree just behind the tent in the photo above, and started walking towards us, seemingly oblivious to the breakfast being eaten.

We grabbed the last few things off the table as we were casually chased out of camp.

The first two miles takes you down a canyon with the densest foliage we had encountered so far. A quick jaunt back up through fields of cactus brings you to The Airport in the Sky, infamous for it’s bison burger. I guess there has to be a payoff for flying into the airport, and that’s entirely condensed into arguably one of the best burgers I’ve ever had. The ultimate [$100 hamburger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$100_hamburger).

{imgs-auto}

![Down and up to the airport](12-jon_133.jpg)

![Hanger walk](13-airport_75.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

After smashing the burger we headed off to a ridge-line, and after a little fire road continued along some beautiful single-lane trail. Before too long Little Harbor came into view, and we began speculating about how the trail continued after that. We spotted a shade structure perched high above the valley, peaking in and out of cloud cover created by the sea-breeze rushing over the cliffs. It looked, as they say, “hella steep.”

{imgs-auto}

![“Oh shit look at this thing up ahead just out of frame”](14-jk_133.jpg)

![Walking. Yeah. More walking.](15-jon_133.jpg)

![Winding down towards Little Harbor](16-little-harbor_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

Little Harbor was pretty amazing; a secluded pair of coves with particularly calm waters. We kicked it for around 30 minutes, wanting to hop in, but knowing we needed to stay on schedule for the day. Ended up skipping stones most of the time. Tbh could spend the rest of my life just skipping stones.

{imgs-auto}

![At this point ready for a break](17-jk_133.jpg)

![We were the only ones there on a Thursday afternoon](18-little-harbor_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

After our siesta we headed off towards what appeared to be a considerable climb. When hiking the TCT you experience a bit over 10,000ft of elevation change in aggregate. This checks out when considering all the up and down. Our climb took us past areas of massive erosion, huge chunks of cliff falling back into the Pacific, some eating up sections of trail.

{imgs-auto}

![Crumbling catci](19-forward_133.jpg)

![Do not hike with your eyes closed](20-jon_133.jpg)

![“Oh shit look at this thing up ahead again”](21-jk_75.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

As we approached cloud-base it really began to feel otherworldly, or at least no longer like a short ferry ride outside of our every day lives in Los Angeles. Up ahead was the shade structure we spotted a few hours earlier, where we gladly caught our breathe and snacked as the condensation rushed past us and threw undulating patterns of sunlight on the valley below.

{imgs-auto}

![Very up](22-up_133.jpg)

![Hitting cloud base](23-jk_133.jpg)

![Shade structure ahoy](24-jon_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

We began the descent into Two Harbors, aptly named when our vantage provided us with a view of the narrow strip of land separating two harbors upon which the small town sits.

{imgs-auto}

![Almost to Two Harbors](25-two-harbors_75.jpg)

![Camp for the evening](26-camp_75.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

We ate and drank at the single restaurant open during weekdays. Most conversations we overheard revolving around how long the year-round residents and staff of the bar have lived on-island. After eating 10x our capacities the half-mile walk back to camp felt longer than the climb earlier that day.

I sent up my bugnet sans-tarp to have a view of the harbor and sky. While dozing off I heard some footsteps. It was a small (and grotesquely adorable) Catalina Fox, staring at me perhaps 15ft away. Closing my eyes again, it took only a few minutes before the sound returned, this time opening them to the fox’s face literally pressed against my net. Clearly this called for a photo. Awakening my phone the bright screen instantly startled the fox, and it yelped the most hight-pitched and panicked yelp as it high-tailed it out of sight.

### Tips

1. Eat a light breakfast and scarf down a burger at the airport, even if it’s only 10am. You’ll be glad you did.
2. Pace yourself up the climb after Little Harbor, it’s deceptively long. Fortunately the air is much cooler here than the valley.

## Day Three

After a quick breakfast we stopped by the Island Services booth to pick up our permit and reserve our locker with water and firewood for Parsons Landing. We also stopped by the grocery store to pick up bites for grilling later that evening.

You start by back-tracking a bit, and end up taking a road the first mile past a small port in the other harbor. Our timing coincided with a boat docking bringing supplies to the town, and several trucks drove past, throwing dirt into the air. The industry, though small, is such a contrast to the previous morning.

{imgs-auto}

![“Welcome to the hell hike”](27-hell-hike_133.jpg)

![Fire road, but level fire road](28-trail_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

The first three miles go UP. FAST. You’re totally exposed and it’s hot as hell. You’re so miserable you can’t help but appreciate how bad it is. Nothing redeeming about this, other than you’ll know it’ll be over soon.

After the worst of it things start to level off a bit, and we were pleasantly surprised to see some cloud cover forming over the cliffs up above, a welcome reprieve from the direct sunlight that had just fried us.

{imgs-auto}

![](30-jk_133.jpg)

![](31-trail_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

After a few miles you’re up there, truly. This peak is just shy of being the highest point on the island, the first being close to Blackjack and providing space for the airport’s [VOR station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range). This was such a welcome break form the climb up, and we hung out in the clouds for a while. We didn’t know quite out intense the path down to Parsons was about to be.

{imgs-auto}

![“Oh shit look at it”](32-jk_133.jpg)

![Descending to Parsons, knees on fire](33-parsons_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

To put it simply, the way back down is, as they say, “hella steep.” This was the only time on the trip where I used both hiking poles to stabilize, and my knees are glad I did. The views were absolutely unparalleled, especially looking back up towards the peak we had just descended from.

![Looking back up towards the peak](34-peak_75.jpg)

While on the way to Parsons we passed a plaque for the Propst Prarie.

> Dedicated to A. Douglas Propst, a transplanted Colorado grass man who came to Catalina Island in 1953 and spent the next fory years restoring the island’s ecosystem. His labor of love helped insure the native landscape.

This got me thinking about the internet as landscape, or network infrastructure and open space. The internet was once a wilderness, but has been over-developed, and because of this we’ve lost areas to simply exist. Tools for sharing photos have turned into platforms for sharing personal ads. Tools for communicating with friends are used to extract taste profiles and create filter bubbles to encourage consumption. I wonder what a conservationist movement for the open web could look like, and if there is room for analogue efforts to Propst’s preservation of the Stipa Pulchera grasslands.

{imgs-auto}

![s/o the grass man](35-grass-man_133.jpg)

![Tarp pitched for shade](36-tarp_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

We got into camp; totally amazing. Our campsite was on the sand, maybe 10ft from the ocean’s edge. Each site is denoted by small rock structures to assist in the persistent winds. I pitched my tarp low and we spent the rest of the day relaxing intensely.

{imgs-auto}

### Tips

1. Don’t get too discouraged on the way out of Two Harbors. Yeah, it sucks, but you’re headed towards remarkable areas.
2. Kick it up top. Don’t rush.
3. Bring trekking poles for heading down to Parsons. Shit is no joke!
4. Ensure your tent is properly staked with heavy rocks once at camp. The wind really picks up as the sun sets.

## Day Four

Technically, the terminus of the TCT is at Parsons, but this is a recent revision. The original end is at Starlight Beach, another 4 miles out towards the eastern tip of Catalina. After packing up camp, we decided to drop our packs in one of the metal food boxes and bring some water and snacks for a quick 8 mile jaunt to Lands End, which is, yeah, the end of the island out near Starlight.

{imgs-auto}

![Looking forward towards Lands End](40-lands-end_133.jpg)

![Looking back to camp at Parsons](39-parsons_75.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

The hike out was super pleasant. The day ended up being a bit overcast, making things a bit cooler and generally calm. Approaching Starlight the trail makes a rapid descent. We decided against that, and to continue along an unmarked side-trail heading towards the very tip of the island.

{imgs-auto}

![“Oh shit it’s the end”](41-lands-end_133.jpg)

![Variegated moss along the cliffs](43-moss_133.jpg)

![A bald eagle reservation prevents you from going further](42-lands-end_75.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

We hiked the 4 miles back to camp, picked up our packs, and continued on the additional 8 miles along a dirt road to Two Harbors, where we’d catch the 9:30 ferry back to San Pedro. It’s a deceivingly long 8 miles, as two harbors always appears quite close, however the coves send you in and out a few times, making it seem to take forever. Still, there was a bit of rain falling, and it was a nice end to the trip.

{imgs-auto}

{/imgs-auto}

There isn’t a sign commemorating the end of the TCT, you just end up back in Two Harbors, which feels a little funny. Overall, super satisfying to have completed the trail, and we celebrated with more food and drinks at the restaurant in town. One drink was the “Bison Milk.” You’'ll have to experience it for yourself. We also realized the patrons we had seen last time were now staffing the bar, and the staff were now patrons.

### Tips

1. Definitely hike out to Lands End. Follow the trail to the left you’ll spot from about where the trail forks off to Starlight. Much more enjoyable considering Starlight is a rocky little beach, and the trail is super steep.
2. DO NOT have a few drinks, a burger, “Bison Milk”, and onion rings before boarding a smaller ferry for a night ride (no horizon line) in choppy waters. It’s rough.

## Thoughts

This was the ideal first through-hike. You’re never more than a few miles away from help, and not once did I have to dig a hole and shit in it. Quite easy. Generally speaking:

1. Keep your pack weight down, but don’t go crazy. Try to stay under 20lbs.
2. I brought 2 Smart Water bottles, each holding 1 liter. This was plenty, as you can always re-fill at least once a day. Just ask for a map in Avalon and check it in the mornings.
3. Don’t bring more than 2.5 days worth of food, as you can eat at the airport the morning of day two and resupply that night (or the next morning) at the grocer in Two Harbors.

Having seen Catalina from Los Angeles for so long, I’m glad to have gotten out there, even if it took a while. A good reminder to simply go for it.

## Gear

Ok, a quick rundown of the gear. While in New York I started to research ultralight gear. I got very into it. What really got me going was the Make Your Own Gear (MYOG) community. My first project was a [Ray-Way backpack kit](http://www.rayjardine.com/ray-way/Backpack-Kit/index.htm).

{imgs-auto}

![Drawing and cutting out the patterns](47-pack_133.jpg)

![Making the straps and back](48-pack_133.jpg)

![The front pockets assemblies](49-pack_133.jpg)

![The bottom corners, terrifying but ok](50-pack_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

For $70 they ship all the material, and expertly crafted instructions on how to assemble the pack. Amazingly it weights only 9.5 ounces. I had never touched a sowing machine before, and this was a great first project to learn from.

{imgs-auto}

![Completed pack front](52-pack_133.jpg)

![The back, proud of the straps](53-pack_133.jpg)

{/imgs-auto}

Sure, it took around 20 hours to make considering my novice experience, but it provided the confidence to then sow the [Yama net-tent kit](https://www.yamamountaingear.com/net-tent-kit/). That was quite simple, although it made apparent how clear the Ray-Way instructions were, as these were lacking. Still, nothing was unsolvable without a few moments to consider what was happening structurally.

Between those two projects I gained confidence to order some material from [Ripstop By The Roll](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/) and improvise a tarp tent off the dome after a little research. Not many photos of these last two projects, as it was mostly a bunch of jumbled fabric and the nerves distracted from documentation.

I highly suggest giving this a try if you’re interested. It is economical, unless your time is precious, and even then the knowledge acquired will far outlast the gear you’ve created. The understanding of production provides you with better judgment for any purchases you make later, too. Making this sort of stuff feels different than a typical DIY project, as it employs advanced technical fabrics and sometimes complex geometry. Still, it’s super fun.

I’ve collected some resources used to create my projects in an Ultralight MYOG [channel on Are.na](#). If you have any questions feel free to [drop a note](mailto:contact@jon-kyle.com).
