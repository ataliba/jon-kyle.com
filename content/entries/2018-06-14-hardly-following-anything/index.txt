It’s been a moment since last publishing something here. Often I’ll sit down to write, but find my attention drifting elsewhere.

TLDR: Social media and their feeds of following and followers is a huge distraction day to day. Because of this, I’ve unfollowed everyone on everything. I’ll still be checking in on everyone, but at my own pace, and I’ve updated a tool for doing that. Will continue to share things, but through my mailing list (in the nav above.)

Expanding on aforementioned distractions, I’ve sometimes depended on blockers, applications which limit access to the internet such as [Self Control](https://selfcontrolapp.com/), for impulse management to varying degrees of success. Actively *disabling* seems to mask the issue, and reveals self-consciousness about my own naïveté considering the privilege of having constant access to “universal knowledge.” Who would consciously disable that connection?

Considering this, can a tool be actively *enabling* in it’s approach to navigating constant connection, not restrictive or limiting?

About this time a year ago I released a project called [Hardly Everything](https://hardlyeverything.com). It introduces a simple change to a familiar interface; the passing of time to The Feed. It essentially allows you to follow you can link to at your own pace.

When following a link you prioritize it by choosing how often you want remember it. Important to you? Once every 3 or 4 days perhaps. Unimportant but don’t want to forget forever? Maybe once every 3 or 4 months. I’m somewhat strict, and after visiting a link I do not return until it reappears in my feed, although there is nothing preventing you from simply visiting the url. This is not about creating a dependency on a tool, but establishing cadence for how your mind craves content.

The passing of time is a subjective experience; pleasant moments are gone as soon as they came, while the unpleasant seem to linger. When following links, rarely did something appear important enough to view more than once a week, although just seven days is an eon relative to the pace of The Feed.

A year after releasing it, I didn’t used it often. My attention seems to crave distraction. Reasons why my usage waned are plenty, but one stands out.

When opening Hardly Everything in the morning and it appearing blank, I didn’t know what to do with myself, other than compulsively searching elsewhere for something to consume. The Ultimate Content Consumers among us will find this emptiness an *extremely unsettling experience*.

The empty page is also unchanging for the entire day, as Hardly Everything updates only once at midnight. If it is empty in the morning, it will remain so until tomorrow. Seen as a problem to be fixed suggests a cognitive hook, or a reason to keep returning. Clearly a compromise. Instead I think of this as one of the primary features.

With this rhythm established, each link being a loop, and the interval being 24 hours, a cadence emerges not bound to determined sequence but instead overlapping durations. Rather than “show me this every second Thursday”, you say “show me this every five weeks”. This creates slippage or phasing between links, ultimately a relation more organic and less rigid.

Over the past few weeks I’ve returned to using it, both in the morning and throughout the day to follow new links. This led to some improvements, like removing the Google Fonts dependency in exchange for a fresh selection of hot open source type.

There was also a moment of downtime a few months ago, and was surprised that several people got in touch about it. The peer-to-peer space is very exciting, and anyone keeping up with my current work knows I spend a lot of time there. 

To avoid outages in the future Hardly Everything is now deployed with [Dat](https://datproject.org). This makes the site available offline with [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com), includes the full source, and saves your links into a Dat Archive instead of localstorage.

There is also a [blog](https://hardlyeverything.com/blog) collecting lists of links from contributors cover what they visit each day, week, month, and year. Visit whenever, but not too often.

That’s about it. With the whole Twitter thing, for many of you, instead of linking directly to your Twitter profile I link to your personal homepage. I like sites and the context they provide.

If you have any ideas feel free to open up an issue on [the repository](https://github.com/jondashkyle/hardlyeverything). To stay in the loop with what I’m up to subscribe to the mailing list (sending out once every month at the most).
