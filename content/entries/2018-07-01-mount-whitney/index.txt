Like most trips, there is an option for the drive between San Fransisco and Los Angeles: the scenic route or the fast route, depending upon your disposition.

The former takes you meandering along what I’d call (w/ modest experience) the most scenic stretch of highway in North America, assuming of course the road hasn’t collapsed into the Pacific during one of the frequent landslides, or is found in an impassible phase of seemingly perpetual repair.

The latter provides an expedited trip via Interstate 5—colloquially “The 5.” Novel the first few times, perhaps if viewed abstractly as an 800 mile line endlessly terminating just out of sight for example, but ultimately a route lined with franchise convenience and designed for speed.

My trance when driving this stretch has only broken when passing the Sierras, distant, but their peaks in view for a while to the east. This was as close as I had been, although I found my head wandering there frequently when reading up on the John Muir Trail as a source of afternoon escapism.

You can imagine my excitement, after returning from [Catalina](/entries/2018-05-26-trans-catalina), when a trip began to form around summiting Mount Whitney. At 14,505ft not only the tallest peak in the Sierras, but the entire contiguous States. The anticipation stemming not from it being “the highest”, but simply an excuse to finally visit an area of those mountains.

## Preparation

Leaving Los Angeles while heading north along The 5, an anomaly appears just after the crossing out of the San Fernando Valley. Cascading down the hillside is the Los Angeles Aqueduct transporting water from the Owens Valley.

Although never having visited the Sierras, they’ve played a critical role in my living in Los Angeles. The annual snow melt makes it’s way to the Owens valley, where a substantial volume enters the aqueduct to be transported hundreds of miles south to Los Angeles for drinking water, as famously depicted in [Chinatown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)).

Seeing as none of us had winter mountaineering experience, like self arresting with an ice axe, this trip was planned to coincide with that annual snow melt. A funny habit of checking the Mount Whitney Forum every other minute developed in the weeks leading up to the trip. While the snowpack is still deep primary ascent is via The Chute, a few thousand feet tall, quite steep, and prone to turning into an ice slide.

Although entirely manageable, and in part due to the popularity of the summit being the tallest, it’s not uncommon for people to be plucked off the mountain in compromised condition due to inexperience. Not only that, some climbers in the week leading up to us became human projectiles and knocked out a group below by failing to self-arrest. As if becoming a statistic is not enough, the risk of unwittingly contributing to the tally through the negligence of others wasn’t very appealing.

This in mind, our only plan to summit involved taking the ninety-nine switchbacks from trail camp. Luckily a few days before departing some folks from [Altra](https://www.altrarunning.com/) reported the all clear. Nice.

## Day One

Our route out of Los Angeles largely paralleled that of the aqueduct, with one brief divergence. After leaving the Los Angeles basin behind us for the open desert, and approaching Palmdale, I looked down and did a double take. Before leaving for any trip I re-pack my belongings several times, mostly to ensure everything is there. Sure enough, the pack was fine, but I had forgotten to put on my hiking shoes!

A quick search led to a Dick’s Sporting Goods, the only viable option provided the uncertainty of if there would be anything suitable between here and Whitney.

The trip up The 14 takes you past a number of geologically fascinating areas. Just a week before I had caught a lecture at [Mount Wilson Observatory](https://www.mtwilson.edu/) by geologist Tanya Atwater who contributed immensely to research on plate tectonics, specifically around southern California and the San Andreas fault. She had mentioned taking fellow geologists to the northern terminus of The 14—just off the highway are seemingly frozen snapshots of [undersea fissures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_volcano) bubbling up out of the desert floor.

Before too long we arrived in Lone Pine, a town located at the base of Mount Witney, and clearly centered around catering to the associated activity. We spotted an airstream trailer with the words “Ultralight Backpacking” on the rear. Sure enough, it was fully stocked with all the best equipment, including Altras. I grabbed a pair of Timps, merino toe socks (why the hell not?), and placed the pair from Dicks back in the box. Huge shout out to [2 Foot Adventures](https://2footadventures.com/)!

We met up with the rest of the group for dinner at Bonanza then headed up to Whitney Portal at 8,364ft. The plan was to acclimate to the elevation over the next two days leading up to summit to avoid acute mountain sickness. With camp setup we went to sleep without much fuss.

## Day Two

The day began by breaking down camp and heading to the Whitney Portal Store for breakfast. Jon ordered a pancake the size of a medium pizza and about as thick as your fist. After securing our permits to our bags we headed to the trailhead, weighed our bags (24lbs fully loaded w/ water) and started the 7 mile hike to trail camp.

</div>

Things start off amongst the pines, still dense at this altitude. Streams of snowmelt from several-thousand feet above provide abundant water. Mixed with the shade of the pines an environment for extremely lush pockets of ferns and the resident insects flourish.

<div class="imgs-auto">

</div>

As the sun continued rising so too did the heat. The base of the mountain is located in the desert, where it was quickly approaching 100°F. Even with the altitude we were feeling it, especially as the treeline approached.

A fork in the trail went to Lone Pine Lake. Although not in the plan for today, we did intend to visit this on the way back. The water looked incredibly inviting.

<div class="imgs-auto">

</div>

As the trail ascended each turn seemed to out-do the last. Maybe this was an accumulating effect, but the “wow”s did not stop coming.

One thing was becoming clear: there was going to be a lot of water on the switchbacks the next day. Ultimately a good sign—indication of snowmelt and providing some appreciated confidence.

</div>

Passing the treeline I began to feel the altitude somewhat. A dull headache. We took a break adjacent the first sizable snowbank on trail. It’s difficult to grasp size out here. Metaphors of scale fail to accurately portray magnitude.

However, after a day, the peaks in the distance still appeared just as large as they did when beginning. Tomorrow was going to be involved.

After the meadow we crested a ridge and my jaw dropped; Consultation lake. Gargantuan. A little exploring was a must, and revealed several camp-sights along the bluff. Knowing we were near trail camp, and how that tends to get crowded, we opted to stay here for the night.

We setup camp and had a few hours to kill. Despite the excessive weight of a hardback book, I brought along [Aereality by William Fox](http://www.counterpointpress.com/dd-product/aereality/), whose work often explores how cognition transforms land into landscape.

The book opens by describing Ansel Adam’s widely recognized photo of Mount Whitney shot from Lone Pine.

## Day Two

After an alright night of sleep the day began at 6:00am. Our packs were significantly lighter today, only bringing the necessary food, water, and an extra layer. We headed from Consultation up past Trail Camp, where quite a few people had already gotten going.

A quick break to double check the time, 7:20am, and we were started up the first of ninety-nine switchbacks towards Trail Crest.

<div class="imgs-auto">

</div>

A few miles later we had our first taste of snow crossing. These areas were well packed and simple to traverse, although a quick glance at the rocks below was enough to reinstate appropriate caution. This became most exaggerated when approaching The Cables. Reports from the days before ranged from requiring crampons and ice axes to bare boots and trekking poles—we found to be somewhat closer to boots and poles.

Seeing as yak-traks were in our packs, we paused to attach them to the soles of our shoes and gauged the quality of the snow. Very slushy, good for the traks to grip into. Jon headed off first and made it with no issues.

<div class="imgs-auto">

</div>

Following The Cables was a lot of “up.” Each switchback increasing our field of view in ways which felt disproportionate to the among of elevation gained.

Our pace was pretty good, and we started gaining on a fellow hiker. As the spacing decreased we heard the sweet nothings of EDM bangers. *Holy shit do speakers on trail bother me*. Two possibilities came to mind:

1. Bring a few pairs of cheap headphones, and upon encountering sonically insensitive hikers say “hello” and ask, “would you like a pair of headphones to better appreciate the fidelity of your tunes?” Passive aggressive, yeah, but come on.<br><br>
2. When visiting the beaches of Southern California the composer John Cage would become annoyed by people endlessly blasting their portable radios. To overcome this agitation Cage composed a piece entirely out of radios simultaneously playing an array of stations. In this way whenever visiting the beach he would pleasantly encounter one of his own compositions and no longer feel the pang of intrusive melodies.

These thoughts behind (and below) us the elevation became more noticeable and the end of the switchbacks came into view. Just one more snow crossing at the top of The Chute and we’d be at Trail Crest.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Down The Chute](40-jk_133.jpg)

![Approaching the end of the switchbacks](41-jk_133.jpg)

![Trail Crest](42-jg_133.jpg)

</div>

Trail Crest really lives up to the name. Approaching the ridgeline, focused on the horizon infront of you, sky gives way to the interior Sierras beneath you. It feels infinite up here despite being firmly planted on granite.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Jon with summit in sight](47-jk_133.jpg)

</div>

The temperature was hovering around the mid-40s and the winds really picked up as we followed the trail along the edge of a *large* cliff into the valley below. Putting the puffy on felt just right, and the views towards the interior was helped renew our sense of “holy shit” after a few hours on the switchbacks.

This section of trail also takes you past several crags which create “windows” through which you can see the Owens Valley. As with many details of this trip, the size was immense, and impossible to communicate through imagery.

The entire Whitney Trail is Class 1, meaning relative ease and no scrambling sections, but this should not discount the effects of elevation, and the last couple hundred feet you’re really sloggin it up. As the hut came into view a wave of excitement began to surge as it became clear we’d summit.

<div class="imgs-auto">

There were perhaps 30 people hanging out at the top—an interesting mix. There were the climbers, who had just scaled the East Face and made me feel extremely pedestrian, and the Instagram models posing in varying states of undress, connecting to the burst of LTE signal beamed up from Lone Pine.

It was a weird scene, and I began thinking about this all as backdrop for social media. The themes I read yesterday in Aereality about the transformation of land (environment) into landscape (image) crossed my mind. Similarly to how an environment like this summit is subject to the same range of ecological crisis effecting me at home regardless of distance, so too does the cognitive pollution and associated behavior of platform technology follow me even here.

How strange to feel so removed from my everyday, hyper-saturated by media, but find myself just as embedded within it.

![“We up here”](54-jg_75.jpg)

After about half an hour at the summit we began our way back to camp. It felt nice to descend after two solid days of non-stop up. The change in light was noticeable, and the air had cleared up a bit. Views though familiar felt new with the fresh perspective.

</div>

Just before reaching Trail Crest the Whitney Trail intersects the Pacific Crest Trail, and here hikers often drop their packs for the two miles up to the summit. Nearing this juncture I saw a few crows hovering in the heavy winds—impressive. Approaching, it became clear they were getting up to no good by getting into people’s packs. There was also a super fat marmot. Can’t say I blame it.

The rest of the way down was smooth and we reached the bottom of the switchbacks at 3:20pm. Not bad.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![“wut”](62-jk_133.jpg)

![Last bit of snow](63-jg_133.jpg)

</div>

Rather than heading directly back to camp we decided to go relax on the edge of Consultation Lake. A lush ravine revealed an easier way down the otherwise jagged and difficult terrain.

The water was almost freezing, literally. Just before our arrival to Whitney this had been frozen over. We challenged each-other to see who could keep the feet submerged the longest, the loser owing the winner a beer when reaching Lone Pine.

I lost after about 30 seconds.

We turned in early after dinner, both from exhaustion and as the winds were significantly higher than yesterday. From camp above we could see the gusts of wind tracing over the lake below, a sort of real-time visualization of air masses making their way down to the Owens Valley.

## Day Three

We slept in a bit, ate breakfast, and broke down camp. The additional weight of the tent back in the pack didn’t feel great, but it was good to know the day was going to be heading downhill.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Apenglow](70-jg_75.jpg)

</div>

As planned, we stopped by Lone Pine Lake. The water was perfect, and we spent quite a bit of time both relaxing by it’s edge and wading around. The surface of the water constantly rippled due to the sheer number of trout swimming around. This area does not require a permit, and I’m certainly planning on visiting again to camp sometime this summer.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Lone Pine Lake](74-jg_133.jpg)

![Blue all around](73-jg_75.jpg)

</div>

Upon reaching Lone Pine we stopped at Merry-Go-Round, a Chinese spot with a $10 afternoon buffet that I absolutely wrecked myself on. Felt great.

Following the aqueduct back to Los Angeles time appeared to pass both slowly and quickly simultaneously. What had been a three day trip felt like *three weeks*; the three hours back to Los Angeles like *three minutes*.

I‘m increasingly interested in finding ways of manipulating my own sense of time passing. Interventions such as this trip are hyper-effective, and help to inspire what I do once home.

## Digest

After this trip I reworked Hardly Everything, a project meant to effect the passing of time in how it relates to our consumption of media and content by introducing cycles and cadence to the feeds we use everyday.

Technology seems to have this capacity to condense time, an obvious fact when considering the march of progress driven by optimization and convenience. Taking a task which took months and implementing a mechanism or methodology to execute in minutes could whimsically be perceived as a form of time travel.

Just as I’d imagine transport by way of time machine to be a disorienting experience, the accumulated effect of all the technology around us sometimes seems to approximate those same fictitious side-effects of dissociation, a sort of environmental jet-lag on a generational timescale.
