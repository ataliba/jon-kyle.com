Like most trips, there is an option for the drive between San Fransisco and Los Angeles: the scenic route or the fast route, depending upon your disposition.

The former takes you meandering along what I’d call (w/ modest experience) the most scenic stretch of highway in North America, assuming of course the road hasn’t collapsed into the Pacific during one of the frequent landslides, or is found in an impassible phase of seemingly perpetual repair.

The latter provides an expedited trip via Interstate 5—colloquially “The 5.” Novel the first few times, perhaps if viewed abstractly as an 800 mile line endlessly terminating just out of sight for example, but ultimately a route lined with franchise convenience and designed for speed.

My trance when driving this stretch has only broken when passing the Sierras, distant, but their peaks in view for a while to the east. This was as close as I had been, although I found my head wandering there frequently when reading up on the John Muir Trail as a source of afternoon escapism.

You can imagine my excitement, after returning from [Catalina](/entries/2018-05-26-trans-catalina), when a trip began to form around summiting Mount Whitney. At 14,505ft not only the tallest peak in the Sierras, but the entire contiguous States. The anticipation stemming not from it being “the highest”, but simply an excuse to finally visit an area of those mountains.

## Preparation

Leaving Los Angeles while heading north along The 5, an anomaly appears just after the crossing out of the San Fernando Valley. Cascading down the hillside is the Los Angeles Aqueduct transporting water from the Owens Valley.

Although never having visited the Sierras, they’ve played a critical role in my living in Los Angeles. The annual snow melt makes it’s way to the Owens valley, where a substantial volume enters the aqueduct to be transported hundreds of miles south to Los Angeles for drinking water, as famously depicted in [Chinatown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)).

Seeing as none of us had winter mountaineering experience, like self arresting with an ice axe, this trip was planned to coincide with that annual snow melt. A funny habit of checking the Mount Whitney Forum every other minute developed in the weeks leading up to the trip. While the snowpack is still deep primary ascent is via The Chute, a few thousand feet tall, quite steep, and prone to turning into an ice slide.

Although entirely manageable, and in part due to the popularity of the summit being the tallest, it’s not uncommon for people to be plucked off the mountain in compromised condition due to inexperience. Not only that, some climbers in the week leading up to us became human projectiles and knocked out a group below by failing to self-arrest. As if becoming a statistic is not enough, the risk of unwittingly contributing to the tally through the negligence of others wasn’t very appealing.

This in mind, our only plan to summit involved taking the ninety-nine switchbacks from trail camp. Luckily a few days before departing some folks from [Altra](https://www.altrarunning.com/) reported the all clear. Nice.

## Day One

Our route out of Los Angeles largely paralleled that of the aqueduct, with one brief divergence. After leaving the Los Angeles basin behind us for the open desert, and approaching Palmdale, I looked down and did a double take. Before leaving for any trip I re-pack my belongings several times, mostly to ensure everything is there. Sure enough, the pack was fine, but I had forgotten to put on my hiking shoes!

A quick search led to a Dick’s Sporting Goods, the only viable option provided the uncertainty of if there would be anything suitable between here and Whitney.

The trip up The 14 takes you past a number of geologically fascinating areas. Just a week before I had caught a lecture at [Mount Wilson Observatory](https://www.mtwilson.edu/) by geologist Tanya Atwater who contributed immensely to research on plate tectonics, specifically around southern California and the San Andreas fault. She had mentioned taking fellow geologists to the northern terminus of The 14—just off the highway are seemingly frozen snapshots of [undersea fissures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_volcano) bubbling up out of the desert floor.

Before too long we arrived in Lone Pine, a town located at the base of Mount Witney, and clearly centered around catering to the associated activity. We spotted an airstream trailer with the words “Ultralight Backpacking” on the rear. Sure enough, it was fully stocked with all the best equipment, including Altras. I grabbed a pair of Timps, merino toe socks (why the hell not?), and placed the pair from Dicks back in the box. Huge shout out to [2 Foot Adventures](https://2footadventures.com/)!

We met up with the rest of the group for dinner at Bonanza then headed up to Whitney Portal at 8,364ft. The plan was to acclimate to the elevation over the next two days leading up to summit to avoid acute mountain sickness. With camp setup we went to sleep without much fuss.

## Day Two

The day began by breaking down camp and heading to the Whitney Portal Store for breakfast. Jon ordered a pancake the size of a medium pizza and about as thick as your fist. After securing our permits to our bags we headed to the trailhead, weighed our bags (24lbs fully loaded w/ water) and started the 7 mile hike to trail camp.

Things start off amongst the pines, still dense at this altitude. Streams of snowmelt from several-thousand feet above provide abundant water. Mixed with the shade of the pines an environment for extremely lush pockets of ferns and the resident insects flourish.

As the sun continued rising so too did the heat. The base of the mountain is located in the desert, where it was quickly approaching 100°F. Even with the altitude we were feeling it, especially as the treeline approached.

A fork in the trail went to Lone Pine Lake. Although not in the plan for today, we did intend to visit this on the way back. The water looked incredibly inviting.

As the trail ascended each turn seemed to out-do the last. Maybe this was an accumulating effect, but the “wow”s did not stop coming.

One thing was becoming clear: there was going to be a lot of water on the switchbacks the next day. Ultimately a good sign—indication of snowmelt and providing some appreciated confidence.

Passing the treeline I began to feel the altitude somewhat. A dull headache. We took a break adjacent the first sizable snowbank on trail. It’s difficult to grasp size out here. Metaphors of scale fail to accurately portray magnitude.

However, after a day, the peaks in the distance still appeared just as large as they did when beginning. Tomorrow was going to be involved.

After the meadow we crested a ridge and my jaw dropped; Consultation lake. Gargantuan. A little exploring was a must, and revealed several camp-sights along the bluff. Knowing we were near trail camp, and how that tends to get crowded, we opted to stay here for the night.

We setup camp and had a few hours to kill. Despite the excessive weight of a hardback book, I brought along [Aereality by William Fox](http://www.counterpointpress.com/dd-product/aereality/), whose work often explores how cognition transforms land into landscape.

The book begins by expanding upon … Something about military activity…

Every few hours, military flights passed overhead. You could only spot them by attempting to understand their direction through sound, then casting your gaze along that estimated line until coming into focus.

Falling asleep I could hear the engines, and would trace the invisible line across the sky from within the tent. It was a strange presence throughout the trip.

## Day Two

After an alright night of sleep the day began at 6:00am. Our packs were significantly lighter today, only bringing the necessary food, water, and an extra layer. We headed from Consultation up past Trail Camp, where quite a few people had already gotten going.

A quick break to double check the time, 7:20am, and we were off up the first of ninety-nine switchbacks before Trail Crest.
