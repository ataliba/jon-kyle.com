text: For the legend. Editorially driven website by [Folder Studio](http://folderstudio.com), preserving the legacy of Tupac Shakur through personal stories from his friends and contemporaries. Canonized at its most potent, Tupacâ€™s legacy remains powerful and relevant to this day.

Front/backend development. Shoutout to [Adam Ferris](https://amf.fyi/) on the WebGL shaders.
