Shattered Streams was an experiment in musical ephemerality, presenting original music from 31 artists throughout May 2016.

Each song was available to stream on a loop for a maximum period of 24 hours, degrading over that time until they simply disappeared.

Inspired equally by the fleeting ecstasy of William Basinski’s Disintegration Loops and the modern emphasis on streaming-centric platforms conforming to listener’s usage and fidelity needs, Shattered Streams presented degradation of both audio and visuals to create an immersive yet ultimately finite listening experience.

Responsible for design and development. Considering the nature of the project not much remains accessible online to view.
