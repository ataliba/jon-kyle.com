text: Between 2009–2016, with a brief break in the middle, I was part of the team behind Cargo (Collective), a personal publishing platform. The project evolved out of tools created for [Space Collective](https://spacecollective.org), a community designed to facilitate a cross-disciplinary discourse about the future of everything.

In the beginning there were only a few of us, and boundaries between responsibilities blurred out of necessity. Truly collaborative. As time passed and the company grew my focus included some design, lots of prototyping, and front-end development. I also advocated for first-class developer tools to compliment the immediate usability of the admin interface.

The internet changed a lot during my years at Cargo. I’m proud of the mark we made together and thankful for the chance to do it. Below are some outtakes from during that time.
