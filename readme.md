It’s my site. some interesting bits. it uses [choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo) as a little static site generator. It’s also published to the distributed web with [Dat](http://datproject.org), and mirrored on [Hashbase](http://hashbase.io) as well as my personal server.

Please excuse the sloppiness. My personal site is somewhat of a sandbox I iterate on quickly. More of a sandbox and not representational of my processes on commissioned work.
